<h1 style="color: white">Journey to A New Lifestyle</h1>
<h2> style="color: white">Watch my journey from the begining of the year</h2>
I have started this journey to a new lifestyle on and off now for about 3 years.

<p style="color: white>Growing up I always played sports,so I was always active and did not worry about my weight.However after highschool I was not active because I stopped playing sports.Over the years I started gaining weight and eating junk! I felt ugly and insecure and miserable in my own body. I wanted help and wanted to drop the weight instantly.I learned the hard way it does not work like that.</p>
<p style="color: white>I started doing my own research on what to eat to lose weight. I wanted the quick way out to drop weightI did not like the taste of fresh spinach and hated eating all veggies. I was not happy with my food ,even though it was helping me.Everyday I would try something new to try and fall in love with eating healthy.</p>

<b>I never thought I would fall in love with working out</b><br>I started watching tik tok videos on how to work out in the gym.I finally raised the courgae to get a gym membership and fell in love.I am not a morning person, but I started going to the gym at 5am! I can now say I am a morning person.However I believe this healthy lifestyle is 20% fitness and 80% nutrition.

I started to put my nutrition first and found so many tast and healthy meals online.My favorite webstie to find easy and delicios meal prep idease is called <a href="https://sweetpeasandsaffron.com/19-healthy-lunch-meal-prep-ideas/ target="_blank">
